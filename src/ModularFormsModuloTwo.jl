    We can represent a modular forms mod 2 by it's coefficients as a polynomial in q or Î”.
    The routines in this file are made for q-series.
    Modular forms modulo 2 have coefficients in q-series being 0 most of the times, and 1 otherwise.
    Thus, we will represent them as sparse 1-dimensional arrays (sparse vectors) of type SparseVector{Int8,Int}.

    disp(f[, maxi])

    Display details of f, a modular forms mod 2.

    Displays what type of data the object id,  up to which coefficient is the form known.
    Then displays the first few coefficients. Coefficients are displayed until maxi (50 by default).
